# local-alerts

#### Is a python program that checks for graphical changes in two different regions of the screen if a change is detected a sound a alarm letting you which of the areas the graphical change was detected.

Things to improve:
* Remove the need of having a hard coded resolution
* Improve the accuracy of detection (sometimes it will missfire depending on a few unknow variables)
* Create a GUI to start/pause/end the program
